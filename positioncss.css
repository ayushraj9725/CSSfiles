/* the position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in as document 
the "Top" ,"Right" ,"Bottom" and "left" peoperties determined the final locatioj of positions elements 
to manifulate the position of anythins on the page we use the above 4 property


-> Static : The top ,rigth ,bottom ,left and z-index properties have no effect
             that mean if we not determine anything the Default value set there by Static
-> relative : the offset i relative to itself based on the value s of top ,right,bottom and left .

-> absolute : the element is removed from the normal document flow , andno space is created for is the element in  the page layout .
              it is the relative to it's closest positioned ancestor, if any ; otherwise , it is placed relative to the initial containing block 

-> fixed : the element is removed from the normal document flow ,and no space is created for the element in the page layout .
           it is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport .
