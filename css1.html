         in real life we what seeing on any website that effective view , amazing style that all are done by helping css 
         basically we use css for making web page more attractive  , we are going to use the css in html structure -->

         <h2 style="color: greenyellow"> Hello world , I am ayush</h2> <!-- that is called inline style color property of css -->

         <button style="color : blue; background-color: yello;">stop</button>

         <!-- inline style method not usefull for large scale so we check 2nd method to use css property that is using selector-->
         <h1>hello</h1>
         <h2>this is ayush</h2>
         <h3>i am a citizen of india </h3>

         <!-- this 2nd method of using css property on web page better but it only work for this file or ant particular specific file 
          because , in real life we have to make many html files that time we cant use this method for using css property , so we need to move on 3rd way-->

          <!-- 3rd way to use property of css using external stylesheet it is like another document file where write after creating and then
           linked with our html file that css document file , so since now we use this 3rd way of writing external stylesheet-->
